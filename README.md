Responsive Navigation
================

Assuming your navigation is using a list, by adding a 'resp_nav' as a class to the container 
the list element's width will change to fit the container. If added to a resize function the 
script will continuously check the width of the container and change the list element's accordingly.
The script will also account for padding that was added by the user or a CMS.
